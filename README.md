# IOE-591-Final-Project

In this paper, we address a variant vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous packages. In
the problem, each customer can order a list of products with different sizes and there could be
multiple depots with inventories of all products. Vehicles are located at each depot, they are
packed with different products to save packing space and then deliver products to customers on
a daily basis. They can only be packed once and need to come back to the depots at the end of
each day
